📦 Dependency Requirement : MySQL Connector/J

The MySQL Connector/J library is required to run this project. It is not uploaded to this repository because the file size is too large for GitHub's recommended limit.

--------------------------------------------------

📥 Download Link

Download the official driver from here : [MySQL Connector/J Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

--------------------------------------------------

🛠️ How to Add to Your Project

1. Download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file and extract the `mysql-connector-j-9.x.x.jar`.

2. In IntelliJ IDEA
   - Go to `File` > `Project Structure` > `Libraries`.
   - Click `+` and select the `.jar` file you downloaded.

⚠️ Important Note
Without this connector, the `DBConnection.java` class will throw a `ClassNotFoundException`. Ensure the `.jar` is added to your Classpath before running `MainApp.java`.

-------------------------------------------------- happy Coding!
